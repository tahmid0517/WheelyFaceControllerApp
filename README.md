Android app to remotely control robot mascot's "face"

In the summer of 2017, a sponsor of my high school's robotics team at the time, SMARTWheel Canada, wanted 2 students to build them a
robotic mascot to help promote their company. The robot we ended up building had a Windows tablet as its "face". As a part of this project,
I programmed a Java desktop app to be deployed on the tablet to act as the robot's "face". I also programmed an Android app to control this "face" discreetly. The Android app would send instructions to the tablet over Bluetooth to change its expression and talk using a text-to-speech library. The latest source code for the Java app that acted as the "face" when I reimaged my laptop (this was before I used GitHub). But, I still have the source for the Android app since it was on my desktop. So, here it is.
